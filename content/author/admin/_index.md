With a Masters of Data Science and competencies in SQL, Python, Apache Airflow, and R, I worked as a data analyst at Airbnb where I helped the Lux Growth team construct end-to-end data pipelines, customer segmentation, and ad-hoc marketing analysis.

I am looking for Data Science and Data Analyst roles.
